# Project Brief

Build a secure, containerized development environment enabling AI agents to work safely within a local workspace using MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for controlled file and command access.

## Goals
1. **Security**: Defense-in-depth container hardening and strict MCP allowlists
2. **Development**: General-purpose tooling for agent-driven workflows
3. **Usability**: Simple Docker Compose orchestration and clear docs

## Success Criteria
- Dev container provides common CLI tools for agents
- MCP filesystem and shell servers are secure and documented
- Workspace is a clean slate for new projects
